## Description

This repository hosts a weather dashboard. Utilizing this weather dashboard you can search cities all over the United States to check weather conditions. Upon entering a city to search you will be presented with current day information as well as a five day forecast.

Each day is equipped with information such as (date, temperature, wind speed, and humdity) as well as a complimented icon representing the weather. 

This application is completely responsive and is designed to work well on a desktop, laptop, tablet, and phone.

The search input will save the previous cities you have searched for securing the results for that city. This will allow the user to switch between recently visted forecast for multiple cities with ease. If you would like to reset your local storage, you can do so by hitting the reset button at the bottom of the search container.
